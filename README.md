# EDUROOTER

EduRooter is a small tool to root EducaAndOS (Or Ubuntu 20.04), as it comes root-less.

---

## * How does it work?

### · Installing

Just execute ```git clone https://github.com/Xabia598/EduKIT``` inside a controlled directory.

### · Executing

You need to execute ```sudo ./eduROOT.sh``` in your terminal **as sudo** and it will automatically inject the username you gave into the sudoers archive.

* The default user and password in EducaAndOS are :: usuario / usuario

## * How do I use it?

As EducaAndOS comes with all users without sudo or root permissions by default, it's recommended to make a external Linux LiveUSB that executes the program with the needed permission so you can escalate privileges.

*TIP: If you want to make it faster, download a headless version of Arch Linux and configure the script to run automatically on-boot :3*

When you connect the LiveUSB to the PC that has EducaAndOS, you will have to search for the Boot menu when it's booting up (ESC, F11, F12... it will vary) and then boot from your USB and execute the script, it should do its function and reboot automatically.
