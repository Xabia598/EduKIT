# EDUKIT

EduKIT is a small toolkit for rooting and making connection shells for EducandoOS 20.04 (Or Ubuntu 20.04).

## * How does it work?

### · Installing

Just execute ```git clone https://github.com/Xabia598/EduKIT``` inside a controlled directory.

### · Executing

You need to execute ```sudo ./eduROOT.sh``` in your terminal **as sudo** and it will automatically inject the username you gave into the sudoers archive. *(NOTE: It will inject it in line 21, it might break)*.

* The default user and password are :: usuario / usuario

## * How do I use it?

In order to root EducandoOS, you must make a Linux Live USB (arch is the fastest one) and load the program in it, as it will mount the partition you indicated and it will need SUDO permission.

*TIP: If you want to make it faster, download a headless version of Arch Linux and configure the script to run automatically on-boot :3*

When you connect the LiveUSB to the PC that has EducandoOS, you will have to search for the Boot menu when it's booting up (ESC, F11, F12, it will vary) and then boot from your USB and execute the script, it should do its function and reboot automatically.
